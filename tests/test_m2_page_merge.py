"""M2 / M2b — the page merge and the M2b reshuffle.

The control plane went from nine pages to five (M2), then the five were reshaped
(M2b): Profiles moved to the top and absorbed Cron and Config, Usage left Activity
and became a page again, the nav lost its group labels and its usage widgets, and
the workspace module stopped being a Setup module.

    Profiles   profiles + the API keys scoped to them + their cron jobs + their paths
    Models     the capability matrix + where those models come from
    Activity   overview + every log realm
    Usage      spend and balances (its own page: a billing view, not a log)
    Alerts     unchanged, and deliberately not part of Activity (R10)
    Setup      unchanged, minus the retired workspace module

Each merged page is server-side tabbed: the sections live in
``templates/jinja/sections/`` and are guarded by the ``tab`` variable, so only the
active tab's markup and script reach the browser.

Three things could rot silently, so they are pinned here:

1. **the nav shape** — retired entries creeping back, group labels returning, or
   the sidebar usage widgets (a second copy of the Usage page) reappearing;
2. **section isolation** — a tab rendering another tab's markup. A guard that
   stopped matching would not raise; the page would just quietly get busier and
   pay for queries it does not show, which is exactly the bug this catches;
3. **the legacy page names** — old links and older call sites still resolving,
   with the tab that now owns that content.
